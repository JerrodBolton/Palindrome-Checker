# Objectives:
Palindromes are words that are spelled the same forward or backward, for example, "radar". For the assignment, you will ask the user to enter a word or phrase and then you will check to see if the letters are the same forward and backward.

## Requirements:
- Create a new page or add your code to the strings.html from a previous assignment.
- Create a loop and add a prompt for the user to enter a string.
- After you notify the user if the string was a palindrome or not, give the user the option of entering another word.
- If the user is done entering words, exit out of the loop.
- Check if the string is spelled the same forwards and backward (hint, remove the spaces before checking).
- Have at least 2 creative elements â€“ images, fonts, background color, etc. 
- Create a nice look and feel for the user and make a great user experience!
- Comment above almost every line of your code, both HTML and JavaScript!
- Put a comment at the top of your HTML file with your name in it.
- Take one or more screen prints of your application running.

## NOTE:

- You MUST use inner html for user validation and palindrome messages(no alerts).
- You MUST use form with submit for all user input
     - You MUST NOT use actionListeners
Remove ALL unused and example code (not commented out)
    - You CANNOT have javascript functions in html
## Deliverable:
    - Submit GitHub repo address.
    - Submit a print screen of your application running.
